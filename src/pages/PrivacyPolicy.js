              consent.
            </p>
            <h4 className="nodify-title primary-color">
              Please note that it is entirely voluntary to consent to Facial
              Recognition – the choice is yours. You are free to withdraw your
              consent at any time. You are also free to delete your Account at
              any time and thus, delete any and all facial recognition data.

            <p>
              Facial Recognition is a method of uniquely identifying a natural
              person based on a digital image of said natural persons facial
              features. Based on an image of the User’s face a number of data
              points are identified. For example, such data point can include
              the relative position of, shape and/or size of facial features
              such as the eyes, nose, cheekbones and jaw. On average 80 data
              points relating to the User are collected, but up to 160 data
              points can be collected.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data points are analyzed and used to create an algorithm that
              is unique for the User. Said algorithm are then used to match the
              Users facial features (in the form of data points) and thus
              provide facial verification.
            </p>
            <p>
              Facial Recognition is based on an image of the User. The image is
              stored only for the duration of verification – on average less
              than a second – and then deleted. The only category of data stored
              for more than seconds is the algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
              The algorithm is stored for the duration of your Account or until
              you update your Facial Recognition data.
            </p>
            <p>
